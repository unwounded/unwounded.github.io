                    <h3>CMP 201; Data Structures and Algorithms 1</h3>
                    <p>With a Software Engineering degree under my belt, this course was
					at most review for me. There were weekly assignments on basic data structures
					and their implementation in C++. The last time I took this course I implemented
					these structures in Java so the knowledge of memory allocation was more than useful.</p>
					<p>Grade: A+</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>CMP 204; Secure Web Development</h3>
                    <p>We were tasked to create a modernized webpage with our choice of subject matter.
					The documentation of this webpage can be found here. /* insert here */</p>
					<p>Grade: B+</p>
                </li>

                    <h3>CMP 210; Penetration Testing</h3>
                    <p>This course was the first instance where I was tasked with learning professional
					hacking techniques. I wrote a white paper on my findings on a device with 
					several notable faults and exploitations. My white paper can be found here.</p>

                    <h3>CMP 202; Data Structures and Algorithms 2</h3>
                    <p>A continuation of the work from CMP 201, I was tasked with designing a 
					project utilizing multithreading of my choice. I chose to design a virtual
					train station simulation. This simulation code is provided here.</p>
					<p>Grade: C+</p>

                    <h3>CMP 209; Digital Forensics</h3>
                    <p>Digital Forensics was a course that revolved around a group's case
					study of a theoretical criminal's hardrive. My group carefully conducted
					an examination of the harddrive's contents and wrote a report on the matter
					which can be found here.</p>
