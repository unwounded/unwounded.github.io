                    <h3>CMP 201; Data Structures and Algorithms 1</h3>
                    <p>With a Software Engineering degree under my belt, this course was
					at most review for me. There were weekly assignments on basic data structures
					and their implementation in C++. The last time I took this course I implemented
					these structures in Java so the knowledge of memory allocation was more than useful.</p>
					<p>Grade: A+</p>

                    <h3>CMP 204; Secure Web Development</h3>
                    <p>We were tasked to create a modernized webpage with our choice of subject matter.
					The documentation of this webpage can be found <a href="cmp204 (2).zip" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

                    <h3>CMP 210; Penetration Testing</h3>
                    <p>This course was the first instance where I was tasked with learning professional
					hacking techniques. I wrote a white paper on my findings on a device with 
					several notable faults and exploitations. My white paper can be found <a href="Penetration Testing-1.docx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <h3>CMP 202; Data Structures and Algorithms 2</h3>
                    <p>A continuation of the work from CMP 201, I was tasked with designing a 
					project utilizing multithreading of my choice. I chose to design a virtual
					train station simulation. The resulting PDF for this project as well as a softmax simulation
					are provided <a href="Stations-1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="SoftMax-1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <h3>CMP 209; Digital Forensics</h3>
                    <p>Digital Forensics was a course that revolved around a group's case
					study of a theoretical criminal's hardrive. My group carefully conducted
					an examination of the harddrive's contents and wrote a report on the matter
					which can be found <a href="Digital Forensic Report 3ensic Group.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
					<p>Grade: A</p>

                    <h3>CMP 308; Professional Project Planning and Prototyping</h3>
                    <p>For our third year, Abertay assigned students in related majors
						to groups working with third party companies on hacking projects.
						For the first semester, we conducted consistent reviews and meetings
						with the client, eventually amounting to a Project Proposal on LoRaWAN 
						hardware.  This Purposal can be found <a href="Bryce Place CMP308 Proposal Template.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, with my particular portions
						highlighted.</p>

                    <h3>CMP 314; Computer Networking 2</h3>
                    <p>In this course, the lecturer gave a theoretical virtual network of a company
					and tasked me with identifying every device on the network whilst conducting test
					to check for security faults and breaches.  The end report of this can be found 
					<a href="Computer Networking White Paper.docx" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
					<p>Grade: B</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>CMP 319; Web Application Penetration Testing</h3>
                    <p>The lecturer gave out a web application and asked me to conduct a 
						penetration test similar to that of CMP 210.  The methodology used
						related to the methodology linked on OWASP's web application webpage.
						The resulting report can be found <a href="BRYCE PLACE CMP319 Web Application Penetration Testing Paper.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
